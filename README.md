## ✈️ Airline Database Analysis – MYSQL Project

## Project Objective

To design and analyze an Airline Management Database using MySQL in order to understand flight operations, passenger trends, booking status, payment performance, and airline efficiency through structured SQL queries, views, and stored procedures.

## Dataset Used

The dataset consists of  Five relational tables created manually to simulate real-world airline operations

    - Airline (airline details and number of flights)
    
    - Flight (flight routes, locations, departure dates)
    
    - Passenger (passenger details and age information)
    
    - Booking (booking records and status)
    
    - Payment (payment amount, method, and status)

## 🔹 Key Highlights

  - Created relational tables with Primary & Foreign Keys
  - Implemented real-time sample airline data
  - Developed multiple SQL Views for data analysis
  - Created Stored Procedures for advanced queries

## 🔹 Views Created:

  ✔ Passenger count by booking status
  ✔ Passenger count by payment status
  ✔ Top 5 flights with highest passengers
  ✔ Bookings made in 2024
  ✔ Airline-wise total flights operated

## 🔹 Stored Procedures

  ✔ Top 3 payments below total sum
  ✔ Senior citizens traveling by flight
  ✔ Top 3 frequently used flight routes

## Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:

  ✅ Database Design
  ✅ SQL Queries
  ✅ Views & Stored Procedures
  ✅ Relational Database Management

## Final Conclusion

This project demonstrates how relational database design and SQL analysis can be used to manage and extract meaningful insights from airline operational data.
The system effectively transforms raw airline data into structured reports that support operational and strategic decision-making.
